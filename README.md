# Employee Polls Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React-Redux course, which is a part of the [React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

It is a web application built with React that enables employees to both answer and create questions, fostering engagement and interaction within the workplace.

It uses Redux to manage application state and includes a leaderboard feature to encourage active participation.

## Technologies used:

- React
- Redux
- React Router
- React-Bootstrap

## To Run This Project

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
1. Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
1. Start the development server with `npm start`

The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods that let you access the data. The only thing you need to edit in the ` _DATA.js` file is the value of `avatarURL`. Each user should have an avatar, so you’ll need to add the path to each user’s avatar.

## Data

There are two types of objects stored in our database:

- Users
- Questions

### Users
